    "Designed to find the number 1’s in a data set. This algorithm uses O(log²N) bits to represent a window of N bit, allowing to estimate the number of 1’s in the window with an error of no more than 50%. So this algorithm gives a 50% precise answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DGIM algorithm, each bit that arrives has a timestamp, for the position at which it arrives. if the first bit has a timestamp 1, the second bit has a timestamp 2 and so on.\n",
    "The positions are recognized with the window size N (the window sizes are usually taken as a multiple of 2). The windows are divided into buckets consisting of 1’s and 0's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for forming Buckets:\n",
    "1. The right side of the bucket should always start with 1. (if it starts with a 0,it is to be neglected) E.g. · 1001011 → a bucket of size 4 ,having four 1’s and starting with 1 on its right end.\n",
    "2. Every bucket should have at least one 1, else no bucket can be formed.\n",
    "3. All buckets should be in powers of 2.\n",
    "4. The buckets cannot decrease in size as we move to the left. (move in increasing order towards left)\n",
    "\n",
    "DGIM Algorithm:\n",
    "The right end of a bucket always starts with a position with a 1.\n",
    "Number of 1s must be a power of 2.\n",
    "Either one or two buckets with the same power of 2 number of 1s exists.\n",
    "Buckets do not overlap in timestamps\n",
    "Buckets are stored by size.\n",
    "Buckets disappear when their end-time is N time units in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of the algorithm:\n",
    "1. Bucket Creation and Update:\n",
    "When a 1 is observed, create or update a bucket. Each bucket has a timestamp and represents a period during which 1s were observed.\n",
    "Buckets are merged if they have the same size or if the time difference between them is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bucket Merging:\n",
    "Merging reduces the number of buckets by combining smaller buckets into larger ones, ensuring that only buckets of sizes in powers of 2 are maintained.\n",
    "buckets are merged to keep memory usage within bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Removing Old Buckets:\n",
    "Buckets older than the current window size N are removed from the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimating Number of 1s:\n",
    "The estimated number of 1s is calculated based on the remaining buckets and their sizes.\n",
    "The formula used is: Estimate = 2^max_register_value, where `max_register_value` is the maximum size of the buckets.\n"
